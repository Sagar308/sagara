  <p >During Rana regime,
    Nawalpur district was a sub-district of
     Chitwan District then it established separately
     and again merged with a small portion (Parasi)
      of Butwal District and established
       Nawalparasi District.
    In 2015 again Nawalpur District separately
     reestablished and became youngest district of Nepal.
     This district plays significant role
      in politics as this
       district has provided important leaders and judges
    to the country
  This district has given birth to many Nepal's top-level people, including the late Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya. The midpoint of Nepal's east–west highway Mahendra Highway lies in this district. The Nawalpur valley is the part of greater Chitwan Valley of inner terai where most of the populations are Tharu, Magar and Brahmins who settled migrating from the hills. The big industries such as Chaudhary Udhyog Gram (CUG),
  Bhrikuti pulp and paper
   factory are located in
    the nawalpur area of
    this district. .</p>

   <p >Chitwan National Park is the first national park in Nepal.
      It was established in 1973 and granted the status of a World
       Heritage Site in 1984. It covers an area of 952.63 km2
        (367.81 sq mi) and is located in the subtropical Inner
        Terai lowlands of south-central Nepal in the districts

         of Nawalpur, Parsa, Chitwan and Makwanpur. In altitude
          it ranges from about 100 m (330 ft) in the river valleys
           to 815 m (2,674 ft) in the Churia Hills.

In the north and west
 of the protected area the Narayani-Rapti river system forms a natural boundary to human settlements. Adjacent to the east of Chitwan National Park is Parsa National Park, contiguous in the south is the Indian Tiger Reserve Valmiki National Park. The coherent protected area of 2,075 km2 (801 sq mi) represents the Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU) Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, which covers a 3,549 km2 (1,370 sq mi) huge block of alluvial
 grasslands and subtropical moist deciduous forests
 .Since the end of the 19th century Chitwan –
  Heart of the Jungle – used to be a
   favorite hunting ground for Nepal's
    ruling class during the cool winter
     seasons. Until the 1950s, the journey
      from Kathmandu to Nepal's south was

       arduous as the area could only be
        reached by foot and took several
         weeks. Comfortable camps were
          set up for the feudal big game hunters and
          their entourage, where they stayed for a
          couple of months shooting hundreds of tigers,
           rhinoceroses, leopards and sloth bears</p>
