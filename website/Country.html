  <p class="paragraph">The flag of Nepal is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular.
    The flag is a simplified combination of two single pennants.
    The flag of Nepal is known as the only flag in the world that is not quadrilateral in shape.
    The flag is a blend of two single flags or pennons.
    It is like two triangles combined, the upper triangle is a ninety-degree triangle with its longer
     side at the bottom while the other triangular shape is placed at the lower portion
      with the shorter side at its bottom. The creator of the Nepali Flag is still unknown
      but the flag is supposed to have existed a long time ago.
      After Prithvi Narayan Shah unified all small principalities of Nepal, the double-pennon flag was adopted. In modern times, the flag's symbolism has evolved to incorporate several meanings. The crimson red
      indicates the bravery of Nepali people and is the country's national color and the blue border represents peace and harmony. The colors are often found in Nepalese decoration and works of art.[3] A theory is that the two points represented peace and hard work, using the symbols of the moon and sun respectively. Traditionally flag of Nepal is derived from Hinduism which is common in Hindu cultures. However, the modern and government-sanctioned representation is of Hinduism and Buddhism, the main religions of the country.[5][6]

The inclusion of the celestial bodies indicates Nepal's permanence and the hope that Nepal will enjoy the same longevity as the Sun and the Moon. The moon also symbolizes the cool weather of the Himalayas, whereas the sun symbolizes the heat and the high temperature of the southern lowlands (Terai).[5] Additionally, the stylized moon represents the calm demeanor and purity of spirit of the Nepali people, while the stylized sun represents their fierce resolve.[7]

During ancient times, the flags of almost all states in South Asia were triangular. Nepal has simply maintained its ancient tradition, while every other state has adopted a rectangular or square version in the European vexillological tradition.[7]

  <p class="paragraph">Mount Everest which is also known as 'Sagarmatha'
     in Nepal is world
  highest mountain. It is about 8848 meter above the sea level.
  It lies on solukhumbu district of Nepal which is very close to China
   border.
  Thousands of trekkers visit to Everest Base Camp and hike to Kala
  Patthar to catch a glimpse of Mt. Everest closely.The first recorded
   efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers.


    As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time,
     the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from
      the
      Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the
       British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col,
   the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m
    (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above
    8,000 m (26,247 ft). Seven porters were killed in an avalanche
    on the descent from the North Col. The 1924 expedition resulted
    in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day:
    George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attemp
    t on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether or
     not they were the first to reach the top. They had been spotted
      high on the mountain that day but disappeared in the clouds,
      never to be seen again, until Mallory's body was found in 1999
     at 8,155 m (26,755 ft) on the north face. Tenzing Norgay
      and Edmund Hillary made the first official ascent of Everest
       in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached
        8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952
        Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou,
         Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak

         from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.

  <p class="paragraph">Lumbini is the birthplace of lord Buddha.
    It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition,
     Queen Mahamayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama
      in 563 BCE.Gautama, who achieved Enlightenment
      some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism.
       Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage
       that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.

  Lumbini has a number of older temples, including the Mayadevi
  Temple, and various new temples, funded by Buddhist organisations
  from various countries, have been completed or are still under

  construction. Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, and the Lumbini International Research Institute are also within the holy site. Also, there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where the Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he had his first bath. At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.

  Lumbini was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.</p>
