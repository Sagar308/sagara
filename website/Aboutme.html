  <p>Currently , I am living at Aberdeen city of Scotland.
  This city is known as city of granite.
   because nearly all of its buildings are made of the pale
    granite that is quarried nearby. Most of the grannite
    was extracted from Rubislaw Quarry, at Hill of Rubislaw,
     which at one time was  the largest manmade hole in Europe,
     this quarry closed in 1972. It is some 400ft deep, and
      although you can't get an idea of this because
       it is full of water,
   you can still look at it through the high fence.</p>
